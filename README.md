ABSTRACT: This project introduces a real-time speech-to-text (STT) system designed for the healthcare sector, with a focus on diabetes management. The system accurately transcribes medical conversations, capturing key information such as glucose levels, medication, and lifestyle details. It supports doctors and patients by streamlining documentation, enabling remote consultations, and integrating with electronic health records. This STT solution aims to improve efficiency, reduce manual errors, and enhance the quality of diabetes care.
